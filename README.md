A collection of utilites I wrote to deal with an old DCS-2121 IP camera.

Currently there's only `acas`, which provides logic to parse the "ACAS" audio
format (or container) used by the camera to handle audio.

`acas` also contains logic and tools to send audio to the speaker or receive it
from the microphone.
